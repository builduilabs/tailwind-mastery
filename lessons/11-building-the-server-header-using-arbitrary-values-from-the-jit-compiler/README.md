# Building the Server Header using Arbitrary Values from the JIT Compiler

To build the server header, we'll override Tailwind's default shadows with three values from Discord's design system. We'll also use the JIT compiler's bracket syntax to get a pixel-perfect match with Discord's UI. Arbitrary values are a powerful way to break out of your design system's values while still being able to use Tailwind's APIs directly in your HTML.
